                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <p><strong>Welcome to Bradner Countryside Smokehouse!</strong><br>
                Where tradition, family, and flavor come together.</p>
                
                <p>Nestled in the heart of Bradner, British Columbia, our locally-owned smokehouse is built on nearly three decades of experience and a deep-rooted love for community, craft, and quality.</p>
                
                <p>Founder Jessica Craig has been honing her skills since 1993, starting in a small butcher shop in Vancouver before continuing her journey in Abbotsford. Over the years, her passion for the trade grew—as did her dream of one day owning a business that reflected her values and heritage.</p>
                
                <p>Jessica's connection to Bradner runs deep—her family has lived here for over 80 years. In 2008, she married and began raising her own family in the same countryside she's always called home. By 2012, life on the farm was in full swing, complete with cows, chickens, horses, and even a curious mule. But through all the changes, her love for the butcher's craft never wavered.</p>
                
                <p>When the local butcher shop she cherished was changing ownership, Jessica stepped in to preserve its legacy. Out of that moment of determination, Bradner Countryside Smokehouse was born.</p>
                
                <p>We specialize in small-batch, artisanal pork and beef processing, with standout offerings like our signature smoked bacon and beef jerky—crafted from wholesome recipes.</p>
                
                <p>Whether you're here for the perfect breakfast cut or the rich, smoky flavor of our jerky, we're proud to share our passion and products with you—crafted with heart, heritage, and a whole lot of flavor.</p>
                
                <p><em>Thanks for stopping by—we're so glad you're here.</em></p>
